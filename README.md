# expenses-App
my dear
The project was established by Expo CLI
The idea: managing the daily expenses of the individual and making a 
complete operation response, deleting an expense, adding, reading, 
modifying an expense, or showing the last spent expenses, and so on...
The expo start command is based on the understanding that there
is an expo CLI on the machine that will run the application
The application is designed based on the separation of tasks
In addition to applying the principle of one responsibility,
that is, each function works to implement one task.
Thank you for your interest. I hope for advice and support.
